### Hi there, I am Mohini. ðŸ‘‹

<br />
I am a recent graduate from Politecnico di Milano, with Master of Science (Laurea Magistrale) in Computer Science. I am an avid reader and a passionate coder. 

I always aim to acquire and develop new knowledge. And being a Polimi student have opened up (various) great opportunity for me. I work well with a team, and I have worked on many projects which you can find in my [repositories](https://github.com/mohini-gupta?tab=repositories).
